An Open Letter to the Defenders of Ideologies that Dehumanize and Divide

To Whom It May Concern,

I write to you not as a politician, a scholar, or a theologian, but as a simple, nondenominational Christian who cannot stand by in silence as the world clings to ideologies that dehumanize, distort, and destroy. I am Western European by birth, a Christian by faith, and a human being by the grace of God—a God whose very existence certain factions in society seem determined to erase.

There is a sickness in our world, an infection of the mind and soul, perpetuated by dangerous philosophies that masquerade as enlightenment but in truth serve only to enslave. I am speaking of Marxism, the hollow ideologies of Michel Foucault, and the so-called Darwinian views that seek to reduce human beings to mere animals—tools of a godless evolution—while justifying abhorrent hierarchies of race and gender.

Marxism: A System of Envy and Ruin

Marxism, the doctrine of class struggle, is a creed born of envy and sustained by hatred. It reduces the complexity of human existence to a base materialism, dismissing the soul, the spirit, and the divine purpose that animates each of us. Marxism claims to uplift the oppressed, yet wherever it has taken root, it has done nothing but deepen oppression, poverty, and despair. It teaches resentment over gratitude, violence over peace, and division over unity. It demands the abolition of religion, the family, and the individual—as though humanity can thrive without its most sacred pillars.

How can such a worldview persist? History itself stands as an indictment of Marxism’s failures, from the gulags of the Soviet Union to the bloodied fields of Maoist China. Yet despite its catastrophic legacy, it is repackaged and preached in schools and institutions across the West, poisoning the minds of our youth against faith, family, and freedom. Why? Because Marxism cannot coexist with God. A godless society is its only goal, for only in such a society can the state become the ultimate authority.

Foucault: A Philosophy of Relativism and Decay

If Marxism seeks to enslave the body, Foucault’s nihilistic relativism seeks to enslave the mind. Michel Foucault, with his perverse obsession with power dynamics, reduced truth to nothing more than a social construct. He taught that morality is subjective, that right and wrong are merely tools of control, and that any claim to objective truth must be dismantled. Foucault’s ideas have metastasized into the modern belief that there is no such thing as truth—only competing narratives.

The result? A society unmoored from reality, where facts are sacrificed on the altar of ideology, where virtue is ridiculed as oppression, and where justice is replaced with mob rule. Foucault’s legacy is not liberation but chaos. It is the justification of depravity, the dismantling of morality, and the silencing of those who dare to uphold God’s natural order.

Darwinian Misuse: A Pseudoscience of Dehumanization

Then there are the twisted misapplications of Darwin’s theories, which have been used to justify unspeakable horrors. To claim that women are somehow “lesser beings,” or that a person’s worth is determined by the color of their skin, is an affront to God and to objective science. Such views are not only false—they are evil. They are relics of a bygone age, perpetuated by those who seek to divide us and who reject the simple truth that every man, woman, and child is created in the image of God.

Let it be stated clearly: science does not support these claims. In fact, Darwinism and evolution itself have been consistently disproven by objective science—where worldview is not taken into account—and the results of such testing and investigation consistently reinforce a young earth and a divine creation. The differences between men and women are complementary, not hierarchical. The notion that race determines worth has been debunked time and again, yet these lies persist because they serve a darker agenda—an agenda that thrives on division, hatred, and the erasure of God’s love from the public square.

The Insidious Agenda to Eliminate God

It is no coincidence that these ideologies—Marxism, Foucault’s relativism, and Darwinian distortions—all share one common goal: the removal of God from society. A godless world is a world where humanity loses its dignity, where morality becomes meaningless, and where power is the only currency that matters. It is a world where the strong prey upon the weak, where life is cheapened, and where hope is replaced with despair.

The proponents of these ideologies claim to seek progress, yet they lead us backward—toward a society more brutal, more divided, and more dehumanized than ever before. True progress cannot exist without God, for it is God who gives us our worth, our purpose, and our moral compass. It is God who teaches us that all are equal in His eyes—male and female, rich and poor, black and white.

A Call to Return to Truth

I am beyond frustrated—not only because these worldviews persist, but because their conclusive disproofs are buried, ignored, or ridiculed. Objective science, history, and reason all testify to the failures of Marxism, the dangers of relativism, and the falsehoods of racial and gender hierarchies. Yet these truths are suppressed because they threaten the godless agenda that has taken hold of our institutions.

It is time to wake up. It is time to reject the lies that divide us and return to the truth that unites us. It is time to restore God to His rightful place at the center of our lives, our families, and our societies. For only in God can we find the dignity, the purpose, and the hope that we so desperately need.

To those who continue to preach hatred, division, and relativism, I say this: your time is running out. Truth will prevail, as it always does. And when it does, may God have mercy on those who chose to fight against it.

All the above has not freed humanity, but imprisoned it. These ideologies have turned the very world we live in into a prison—a place where hearts are shackled by despair, minds are trapped in lies, and souls are deprived of the light of God. It is time to tear down these walls and break these chains, for only through truth, through God, can we find freedom.

Sincerely,
A Frustrated Christian Who Will Not Be Silent
