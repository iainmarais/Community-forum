//How can one create a C# object notation format that can be used for configuration or message passing?

/*
Objectives
1. It should resemble C# objects.
2. It should use similar constructs for strings, chars, numbers, etc.
3. Classes could be used to represent the equivalent of ini file sections.
4. Using get and set should determine whether values can be read from or written to configuration keys.
5. Comments should be supported. The reason for this is simple, since it allows one to write in-line explanations of what configuration variables do.

Implementation ideas
1. Use an extension such as .cson
2. Serialise and deserialise into the appropriate datatypes for message passing.
